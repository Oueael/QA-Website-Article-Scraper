# QA-Website-Article-Scraper

Just included the JS file. Install the dependencies like playwright as needed.

Optimized for Yahoo article titles as an example. Please visit /robots.txt and/or fair-usage policies before using on any site.

Uses playwright and the html selectors on this example may change over time so it may break.
